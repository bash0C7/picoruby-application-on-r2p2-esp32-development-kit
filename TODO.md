## 🔴 技術的負債（Technical Debt）

✅ **Phase 5: device.rb Security & Dynamic Rake Task Handling** — COMPLETED
- Prism-based Rakefile AST parsing with whitelist validation
- RakeTaskExtractor class with Prism::Visitor pattern
- All 130 tests passing, 88.0% line coverage, 60.47% branch coverage
- See [Phase_5_Prism_Implementation_Guide.md](Phase_5_Prism_Implementation_Guide.md) for details

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### CLI Command Structure Refactoring

- [ ] Consider renaming commands in future if needed (e.g., `pra build-env` or `pra workspace`)

## 🔒 Security Enhancements (Do not implement without explicit request)

All security enhancements below do not change behavior and should only be implemented with explicit user request.

### Symbolic Link Race Condition Prevention

- [ ] Add race condition protection to symbolic link checks
  - **Where**: Symbolic link validation in `lib/pra/commands/build.rb`
  - **Problem**: TOCTOU (Time-of-check to time-of-use) vulnerability between check and usage
  - **Solution**: Use File.stat with follow_symlinks: false instead of File.symlink?
  - **Note**: Limited real-world risk, low priority

### Path Traversal Input Validation

- [ ] Add path traversal validation for user inputs (env_name, etc.)
  - **Where**: All command files in `lib/pra/commands/`
  - **Problem**: User inputs like env_name could contain `../../` without validation
  - **Checks needed**:
    - Reject paths containing `..`
    - Reject absolute paths
    - Allow only alphanumeric, hyphen, underscore
  - **Solution**: Create `lib/pra/validator.rb` for centralized validation
  - **Testing**: Add path traversal attack test cases
  - **Note**: Current codebase is developer-facing tool with limited attack surface
